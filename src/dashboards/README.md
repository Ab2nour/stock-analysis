# Dashboards folder
This folder contains all the dashboards made with Dash.

# How to launch a dashboard
Dashboards should be executed from the root folder, ie:
```bash
cd stock-analysis
```

Then launch the dashboard `plot-stocks.py` with this command:
```bash
poetry run python src/dashboards/plot-stocks.py
```
